### Who am I? 👨🏻‍💻

>My name is Otavio, and I'm a 19 years old brazilian student of ***System Analysis and Development*** at [Unip](unip.br) (Universidade Paulista).
>
>Rn i'm participating of a ***bootcamp*** and studying to become a ***fullstack dev***, while I do it I'm ***hosting*** a stream at [Twitch](twitch.tv/strangepoison) where I try to ***document*** my way to become a Junior Dev and get hired.



### My purposes! 💪

> If you're asking "why are you streaming your way to become a dev?" well, I'll explain. For a long time, the difficulty in actually exposing my professional competence was the reason why I didn't want to work as a developer. It felt like applying to be a translator without knowing if I could speak the foreign language in the way that I should. Even though I've done it for the last three years I didn't felt like I could prove my programming proficiency or even know if I was capable of filling that job opening, and that was the main thing that held me down.
>
> At the time I didn't had the maturity to sit and actually think of a way, I saw my friends get hired and was too shy to ask them how could I do it too. So, to prevent future aspiring developers to pass through this situation I'm doing a documentation of the way that I took to make it.
>
> I believe that education is a right of every living people, that information should reach everybody and as long as I can I'll do my best to make my part ;).
>
> **Getting there alone, is getting anywhere. None of us is stronger that all of us together.**
